<h1 align="center">Welcome to The Project: Analysis on the Factors Affecting Self-Rated Health of the Elderly in China 👋👋</h1>


## Overview

China's population is aging at an extremely rapid rate. It is expected that China's population aged 65 and above will increase from 119 million in 2010 to 360 million by 2050. The health problem of the elderly is a social issue worthy of attention. This study uses the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011-2012 baseline survey data, and uses multi-level generalized linear models to try to evaluate the factors that affect self-rated health from both the community and individual levels.



## Data Source

The CHARLS dataset can be obtained from the official website of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) at https://charls.pku.edu.cn/. The dataset is available for free and requires registration to access.

## Data Description

The dataset contains multiple waves of survey data collected over time, allowing for longitudinal analysis. It covers a wide range of variables, including but not limited to:

-	Demographic information (e.g., age, gender, education level)
-	Health-related information (e.g., chronic diseases, disabilities, healthcare utilization)
-	Cognitive function assessments
-	Economic indicators (e.g., income, employment status, retirement plans)
-	Social and family characteristics (e.g., marital status, living arrangements)
-	Geographic information (e.g., region, urban/rural classification)

The dataset is organized in a structured format, typically provided in commonly used data file formats such as CSV or Excel.

## Metadata Standard

The CHARLS dataset adheres to the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) metadata standard. DDI provides a comprehensive framework for describing and documenting survey data, including information on study design, data collection methods, variable definitions, and data organization. The use of DDI ensures standardized and interoperable documentation of the CHARLS dataset.

## Data preparation

This study uses the individual and community levels as the basic framework to re-evaluate the influencing factors of the elderly's self-rated health. 

-	At the individual level: demographic variables, socioeconomic variables, lifestyle variables, health and medical-related variables;

-	At the second level, the community level: community environment, community population, labor force and other factors are analyzed.

This data uses the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) metadata standard. DDI is an open source, free and widely used standard. I didn't look for template. I think the README should be concise and concise, so I wrote this document myself. I use an online markdown editor. This eliminates the need to download software and is very convenient to use. And it can display the effect of markdown in real time, which is of great help to me. I think the hardest part is figuring out what research direction I want to take and finding a suitable, reliable and universal data source.
